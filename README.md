# Concurrent Collections Example

This solution contains C# code which is an example of C#'s concurrent collections, `ConcurrentStack` to be specific.

The example shows sequential usage of both `Stack` and `ConcurrentStack` and then concurrent usage of both. The output of each usage is then checked to ensure it is correct, with the output being printed to console.
